# LipNet Implementation with Streamlit UI

This project reimplements LipNet, a lipreading model, and integrates it with a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

## Overview

LipNet is a lipreading model designed to interpret human speech by analyzing lip movements. This project provides a streamlined implementation of LipNet and enhances it with a web-based UI powered by Streamlit.

## Features

- **Lipreading Model:** Implements the LipNet architecture for accurate lipreading from video data.
- **Streamlit UI:** Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the lipreading model.
- **Data Selection:** Allows users to choose input data sources (videos) for lipreading analysis.
- **Real-Time Lipreading:** Capable of processing lip movements in near real-time for quick feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks for model implementation.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for creating the user interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic styling and layout for the Streamlit app.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/lipnet-streamlit.git
   cd lipnet-streamlit

2. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  **Run the Streamlit app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py 


## Usage

- Select a video file or webcam input for lipreading.
- Wait for the model to process the video and display the interpreted text.
